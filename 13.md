## 🛠️ Steps to Solve
1. they give us ```cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}``` It look like rot13 and they even asking us if we know about rot13 so This is quit EASY
2. open Cyberchef *https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/* . It the tool that can help us alot in cryptography
4. paste down the weird line then serch up rot13 in cyberchef serch box and drag it in Recipe zone
5. Your flag will be at output

### 💻 Tool Used
#### Cyberchef
CyberChef is a browser-based cybersecurity tool that lets you quickly decode, encode, convert, and analyze data using drag-and-drop “operations.” It’s basically a Swiss Army Knife for CTFs We use it to handle Base64, hex, hashes, ciphers, and data extraction without needing command-line tools. It shows input, steps, and output in real time, making it perfect for fast problem-solving
